TEAM TIMELINE

Shows the teams in parallel coordinates splitted by year
Shows besides the team the "team leader"

It should be zoomable by year, then show the team, and a player list ordered by "best to worse"
Highlight the best player

Maybe it should be zoomable by player and then show complete player info with their star plot and yey
